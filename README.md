 This is a basic implementation of a popular kids toy - a magic eight ball! You can visit the site [here](https://aasiyahf.github.io/magiceightball/)! All you have to do is type a question you want answered in the input bar and click the "Ask me!" button to get an answer. The input is erased every time you ask a question so you can keep asking as many questions as you want.
